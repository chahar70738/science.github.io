    <h3 style="font-family: fantasy; text-align: left;"> Argument One</h3>
        <p style=" text-align: left">The earth is an unmovable disc, centered at the north pole and an ice wall around the edge instead of antartica.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: right; font-family: fantasy;">Evidence against</h3>
        <p style="text-align: right;">when you watch a boat sail towards the horizon the boat appears to sink into the water.
        That is caused by the curvature of the surface the boat is sailing across. 
        Constellations can only be seen at certain latitudes and disappear the farther north or south you go.

    <h3 style="font-family: fantasy;  text-align: left">Argument Two</h3>
        <p style=" text-align: left">The earth is accelerating upwards at 9.81m/s2 creating an ilusion of gravity</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: right; font-family: fantasy;">Evidence against</h3>
        <p style="text-align: right;">The first and second point contradict each other. 
            The earth is not the only case of gravitational pulls we can measure.
            Henry Cavendish in 1797 was able to prove the gravitational pulls of two metal spheres.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: fantasy; text-align: left">Argument Three</h3>
        <p style=" text-align: left">The sun and moon are 50km in diamiter and circle the surface of thre flat earth</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: right; font-family: fantasy;">Evidence against</h3>
        <p style="text-align: right;">The shadow over the moon in lunar eclipses are rounded. 
        Also the mere existence proves that there are at least two sides of the earth
        because it has to be between the sun and moon for the shadows to appear and lunar eclipses donâ€™t happen everywhere at the same time.</p>
